## !HHIH format 

Network Byte Order / Big-Endian):

The ! character specifies network byte order, which is big-endian. This means that the most significant byte is read first (big-endian format is used in network protocols like DNS).

H (Unsigned Short - 2 Bytes):

H represents an unsigned short integer, which is 2 bytes (16 bits) long.
It can store values between 0 and 65535 (because it is unsigned).

H (Unsigned Short - 2 Bytes):

Another unsigned short integer (again 2 bytes, same as the previous one).
I (Unsigned Int - 4 Bytes):

I represents an unsigned integer, which is 4 bytes (32 bits) long.
It can store values between 0 and 4294967295 (because it is unsigned).
H (Unsigned Short - 2 Bytes):

Another unsigned short integer (2 bytes, as before).
